# vaccinedistribution
A program idea to allow users to make accounts and enter details about themselves related to the corona virus and lets administrators enter parameters to notify those who are or are not eligible to get the vaccine.

Current Improvements Being Made
  -notifying eligible users with plyer everytime admin creates new set of parameters
  -forgot password feature
  -adding more medical conditions users/admins are allowed to select/restrict
  
Notes
  -this is only backend
  -run main.py
  -some parts of code (password/username/email of master account, firebase authentication key) are left out as empty strings for obvious reasons
  -the medical conditions that users are allowed to select are from https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/people-with-medical-conditions.html#:~:text=Chronic%20lung%20diseases%2C%20including%20COPD,severely%20ill%20from%20COVID%2D19.
  -please suggest changes or ideas (other features the program should include, problems/improvements for code, etc)
